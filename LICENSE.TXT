Zeke Public License (ZPL) Version 1.0

Copyright (C) 2025 ZekeV
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of this license text is not permitted.

Preamble

The Zeke Public License is a license for free software. Its goal is simple: ensure that software remains open, transparent, and modifiable for everyone. You can use, share, and improve software covered by this license, but if you modify it or base new work on it, you must share your changes under the same terms.

Unlike proprietary software licenses that take away your rights, the ZPL exists to protect them. We believe that freedom in code means freedom in creation. Software should not hide its inner workings or lock users out of understanding or improvement.

Under the ZPL, original works may be distributed as open or closed source, at the developer’s discretion. However, forks and derived works must be open source so that freedom continues to flow downstream to all users and developers.

To protect your rights, this license ensures that others cannot remove these freedoms from you. You may charge for distribution or services, but you cannot make a ZPL project proprietary or restrict access to its source.
